# GroupMe Bot Driver
This driver is written entirely in Python, and with easy configuration in mind.

Using this driver, you'll be able to monitor multiple group chats with ease and set custom rules for each one (or the same for all, if that's what you want). For easy maintenance, each group's rules will be kept in their own files. I have also taken care to make debugging simple and logs easy to read, but more on that later.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This driver has been build around Heroku. While you may run it elsewhere, I will only be reviewing Heroku for now.

1. If you don't have an account, register for free at [signup.heroku.com](https://signup.heroku.com/). You will **not** be asked for a credit card, and I do **not** recieve any kickback.
2. You will also need a GroupMe account (but since you're looking for a bot, you probably already have one).
3. You will be given the option to host on HerokuGit or GitHub. If you choose to host on GitHub, you will need an account here.

Real simple.

### Deploying the bot

You have two choices for installation. You can host your code on HerokuGit, or GitHub. I personally host on GitHub, but Heroku's experience should be similar.
